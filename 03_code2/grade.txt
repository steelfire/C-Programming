Checking code2.c for legal syntax
temp.c: In function ‘printTriangle’:
temp.c:6:8: error: ‘i’ undeclared (first use in this function)
   for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        ^
temp.c:6:8: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
temp.c:7:10: error: ‘j’ undeclared (first use in this function)
     for (j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
          ^
temp.c: At top level:
temp.c:35:1: error: expected identifier or ‘(’ before ‘}’ token
 }
 ^
The code did not have legal syntax!
